            <p>
                Welcome! We appreciate your visit to our site. As a non-sectarian, non-profit shelter serving the Shoals and nearby counties, we rely on local church and volunteer support. Open November 27 to March 17, our nightly locations vary, with a consistent intake center directing guests each evening. Your support means a lot, and weâ€™re eager to foster lasting connections with our guests!
