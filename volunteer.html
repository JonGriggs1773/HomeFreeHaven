            Most all our work is centered around providing for our guests here at Home Free Haven. Often it will entail helping set up the location for the night, helping greet guests at intake, or just simply giving out food or cups of coffee. We encourage our volunteers to meet with our guests and get to know them. Many friendships have been made through volunteering and we encourage others
            to participate.
