            <h3>Guest Info</h3>
            <p>
                We here at Home-Free Haven would like to welcome you to our organization! We are a
                cold-season shelter that operates in the Shoals area. As of this season, we do not have a building for our own intake center. However, our intake location can be found in front of the Walgreens on 109 E Dr Hicks Blvd, Florence, AL 35630, the same location Room in the Inn would previously operate. We are operating in a similar fashion as RITI, where each night we will use a different facility to provide room and board for our guests. We will be open on Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (as well as emergency nights as needed). We look forward to having you as a guest!
