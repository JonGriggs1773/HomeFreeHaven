            <h3>Job Details</h3>
            <p>
                While our organization is built on the backbone of volunteers, we also have opportunities for
                employment. As our business is volunteer based, we do have shifts open from 8 PM to 6 AM for those that would be interested
                in providing guest services throughout the evening at our partner facilities. This would entail being a Guest Services
                Representative, where you would ensure the facility is maintained and in good order throughout the night, provide anyaccommodations, and monitor the evening to make sure our guestsâ€™ needs are met.
